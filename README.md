## Contributions

Bill Qian contributed to the development of the Kubernetes infrastructure, including the deployment scripts, the scheduling workflow, the process wrapper for compute, and the monitoring agent. Furthermore, he designed the CCL enhancements and implemented communication across various channels in the system. Finally, he helped set up the final multi-node Kubernetes cluster and optimized for performance.

Jewon Im contributed to the implementation of the monitoring agent and server, failure detection, and the sample GPT training script used in experiments. Furthermore, she helped implement some of the CCL functions and the log reporting. Lastly, she helped set up the final multi-node Kubernetes cluster and ran experiments.
